            Q-riocity is IIIT Pune's quizzing society, like the{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">
              dead poet's society, minus the poets.

          <p>
            Q-riocity, also widely known as QRC, is where you interact with your
            seniors, conduct and attend quizzes on topics such as commercial
            aviation to the Mahabharata, discuss the latest geopolitical events
            and analyse them, debate Snape's character arch—whew, all under ONE
            ROOF!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Joining QRC in the first year is relatively simple; you just have to
            show up, but the real achievement lies in maintaining this
            membership past the first year, for which you have to do the
            herculean task of, (any guesses), showing up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our free time, we're also the exclusive quizmasters of IIIT Pune,
            like the Warden of the Quizzes. We tried calling our club leads
            that, but it didn't stick.

          <p>
            We wholeheartedly agree with Stalin's words, "Quantity has a Quality
            of its Own", but he went out of fashion ages ago, and SFs around the
            world have limited membership. So we at QRC follow the same
            principle until it remains in vogue. We may not have as many members
            to form our very own PLA, but those that we do have are surely worth
            more than a pineapple in the 17th century.

            We may be geeky, nerdy, introverted, uptight, not funny, or grumpy
            when our quiz time slot is usurped, but we shall never be boring.
