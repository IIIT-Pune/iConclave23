  "2 Participants of each team will compete in the relay race with self-made bots.",
  "The bots cannot be constructed using ready-made 'Lego kits' or any ready-made mechanism. But they can make use of readymade gear assemblies. Violating this clause will lead to the disqualification of the team.",
  "The dimensions of the bot should be less than or equal to 300 mm X 200mm X 300mm (lxbxh) failing which the team will be disqualified from the competition (this excludes the dimension of the gripper but includes tires). The bot can, however, extend its dimension once the run starts. An error of (±5%) is permitted.",
  "The bot must be controlled manually via a controller or commands.",
  "One team can have a minimum of 2 members and a maximum of 4 members (2 controlling drivers and rest support/handlers).",
  "Students from different educational institutes can form a team.",
  "Teams can use both wired as well as wireless control mechanisms. In the case of wired bots, the length of the wire should be a minimum of 2 meters so that the wire remains slack at any instant of time. If the participants use a wireless mechanism they have to use either a dual-frequency remote, Bluetooth, or Wifi.",
  "The dimensions of the remote are not included in the size constraint of the bot.",
  "The Bot must have an onboard power supply in any case.",
  "One person is not allowed to control both the bots and The Duo is not allowed to switch bots or controllers mid race.",
  "Failing to meet any of the above specifications will lead to immediate disqualification",
  "The participants should use a non-electric power supply i.e. the power source should be DC and on the bot itself.",
